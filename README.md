# Chess-Reinforcement-Agent

Using my knowledge from Snake Reinforcement Agent to make a Chess Reinforcement Agent

Aiming to make a reinforcement agent to play against eachother in chess, such that they can learn how to play and win
This will be a small project, throughout the months of May - July, with little help or tutorials to make

Aiming to use my previous project to help my make my own reinforcement agents, in hopes of applying this theory in other areas in the future
