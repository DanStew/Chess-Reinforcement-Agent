# Chess-Reinforcement-Agent

Using my knowledge from Snake Reinforcement Agent to make a Chess Reinforcement Agent

Aiming to make a reinforcement agent to play against eachother in chess, such that they can learn how to play and win
This will be a small project, throughout the months of May - July, with little help or tutorials to make

Aiming to use my previous project to help my make my own reinforcement agents, in hopes of applying this theory in other areas in the future

Project Update :

Pygame_Chess_Game.py has been created. This is a chess game within pygame that can be completely controlled by two human players

chess_game_agent.py has been created. This implements the functionality for an agent to be able to play chess and make moves on the board

However, currently, chess_game_agent.py and its related files are too inefficient. I'm having the problem of the PyGame game stopping responding and therefore I am unable to properly train or test this agent's ability to learn chess until these inefficiency issues have been solved.

Due to priorities, I am having to move on from this project for a bit however this project should be very close to completion, if these inefficiency issues are able to be resolved. Some minor additional tweaks would be needed afterwards however these can only be done once the agent is properly able to play the game without it crashing.
